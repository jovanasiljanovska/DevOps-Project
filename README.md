# DevOps-Project


This project was developed and focuses on applying modern DevOps practices to a real-world, full-stack application. 

For this purpose, an open-source application named **TaskTraverser** was selected. The application is a simple task management system that allows users to create and view tasks. It consists of a frontend web application, a backend ***REST API***, and a ***PostgreSQL*** database, making it suitable for demonstrating a multi-service architecture.
